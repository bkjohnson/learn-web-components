# Learn Web Components

This project is meant to serve as a way to learn how Web Components work and how to use them.
The intended audience is frontend engineers who have some familiarity with React, but not necessarily any familiarity with Web Components.

## Material

The only things needed for this project are a `yarn` installation. The main dependencies we wil be using are [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com) for building Web Components, and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) to set up a simple React app.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
yarn
```

This will install all of the required dependencies.

To set up a simple dev server to serve static HTML pages, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

To build the components for production, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

To run the tests for the components, run:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Exercises

This project is organized into several different exercises to teach the core concepts of Web Components and some Stencil features.


### Exercise 1

Exercise 1 is about using props on an already provided Web Component.

### Exercise 2

Exercise 2 is about adding props to an existing Web Component definition.

### Exercise 3

Exercise 3 is about firing Custom Events.

### Exercise 4

Exercise 4 is Custom Events continued. This will focus on event handling and using internal State.

### Exercise 5

Exercise 5 is back to Web Components. It will focus on the lifecycle methods and templating using slots.

### Exercise 6

Exercise 6 is where we will piece all of the components together to build a very simple app.
